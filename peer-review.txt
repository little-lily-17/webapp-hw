#Peer Review 

a. In your private estimation, what fraction of the overall project did each team member
complete? These fractions should total 100%. If you are on a two-person team and you
believe you both contributed equally, for example, your answer should be 50% for both
team members.

Nurlaili: 30%
Mook: 30%
Omoefe: 17%
Rushab: 23%


b. Positively evaluate your own contributions to your project, without mentioning your
teammates in any way.

I think I contributed pretty well for the project. I implemented some key features of the 
website and helped other teammates too. From my perspective, the team dynamics was good 
although the contributions were not equal. However, I do not think we have any conflicts. 
We communicated all problems through WhatsApp group and face-to-face meeting.

For me, sometimes it was just bothered me if some people's code were messy and hard to
understand. I was always trying to fix it, but I asked them first before making any
changes.
