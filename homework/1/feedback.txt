- Do you need photo and name on profile page? Because it will be repetitive. It is only one user.

Feedback from Vivian Wang
- The overall design is good.
Additional suggestions for the implementation:
- Add max length to the text area.
- Menu dropdown, if it is hard to implement, can use a plain menu. 

Feedback from Nanda Firdaus
- Put the number of love, comment and retweet in the button
- Inconsistent words for sign in and log in
Additional suggestions for the implementation:
- Wrong placeholder for username and email address in register page
- Logo in register page should redirect to login page
- Better to redirect user to profile page when they click on profile picture
