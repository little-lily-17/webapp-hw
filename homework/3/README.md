To turn in homework 3, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

Note:
- The "add-item" function will not post anything if the users do not type anything on the form.
However, if they type a space character, it will be posted.
- I've tried to create a function to handle page not found but it's only running if the DEBUG mode is disabled.
